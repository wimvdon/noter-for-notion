## 2026-10-15: Android's backup copies settings only, from an allow list

Users expect their settings back after a reset or on a new phone, and Android does that for free with its own backup (Google account) and phone-to-phone transfer. The template now lists exactly one file, the DataStore `backed_up_settings`, in `data_extraction_rules.xml`; everything else stays on the phone. An allow list means a file added later (a sign-in token, device state) is never backed up by accident, and `BackupRulesTest` fails if the rules drift. Rules for what goes where are in `docs/architecture.md`, "Backup". Rejected: backing up everything with exclusions (one forgotten exclusion leaks a token into the backup), switching backup off (users lose their settings) and our own backup to Google Drive (needs network access, sign-in and more code for what Android already does).

## 2026-10-15: Phone testing doesn't block merging

The owner can't review code and can't always test a pull request on the device right away, so pull requests waited for a manual test that adds little over CI. Green CI (unit tests, lint, builds) is now enough to merge; the owner tests afterwards with the steps from the pull request and always before a release, and problems are fixed in a new pull request. Merging to `main` does not reach users: releases stay manual. Rejected: keeping the phone test as a merge gate (pull requests pile up and go stale).

## 2026-10-15: Code is "all rights reserved" by default

Without a `LICENSE` file the legal default is already all rights reserved, but that isn't visible and is easy to misread for a public repository. The template now ships an explicit all-rights-reserved `LICENSE`, so every app starts strict and the owner opts in to sharing. Switching to a permissive licence (MIT or Apache-2.0) is a one-file swap, described in the README. Rejected: a commented-out alternative inside `LICENSE` (GitHub and licence scanners read the whole file, so it would be misdetected) and starting with MIT (opening up later is easy, taking it back for code already shared is not).

## 2026-10-14: Shared design rules have their master copy in the template

`DESIGN.md` was kept identical in the three sibling apps by hand, with no single place to start a change, and the copies had drifted (Snoozer was missing the Loading section; the Tracker for Simkl icon row was out of date in two apps). The android-app template (`wimvdon/android-app`) now holds the master copy; each app keeps a full copy so Claude sessions can read the rules without opening another repository, and only its "This app" section is its own. Rejected: keeping the file only in the template (sessions in an app would have to fetch it every time) and a shared library for the design kit (a new dependency and more setup than three small apps need). The design kit files (`ui/theme/`) stay in the apps.

## 2026-10-13: Template baseline

- **Language/UI:** Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Material 3, single `app` module. This is Google's
  recommended, mainstream stack with the most documentation and examples.
- **Tool versions (latest stable on this date):** Gradle 9.8.1, Android Gradle Plugin 9.4.1
  (uses its built-in Kotlin support, so no separate `kotlin-android` plugin), Kotlin 2.4.21
  (Compose compiler plugin), Compose BOM 2026.09.00. Dependabot keeps these current.
- **minSdk 31 (Android 12).** The owner installs apps on their own, recent phone, so older
  Android versions aren't worth the extra code and testing. Android 12 brings Material You dynamic
  colour (no fallback code path), the modern splash screen and per-app language settings. It still
  covers the large majority of active devices. Lower it only if someone with an older phone needs
  the app.
- **compileSdk / targetSdk 37 (Android 17)**, the latest stable API level. The minor SDK release
  37.2 exists but isn't needed by anything yet.
- **Java 17 bytecode, JDK 21 to build.** JDK 21 is what Claude Code cloud sessions provide, so local
  checks match CI exactly.
- **Version numbers:** release `X.Y.Z` → `versionCode = X*10000 + Y*100 + Z`, passed in by the release
  workflow. All other builds use `git describe --tags --long` (e.g. `1.2.0-3-gabc1234`), falling back to
  `0.0.0-dev`, so a dev build can never be mistaken for a release. Version logic lives in
  `scripts/release_version.py` (unit tested) and `app/build.gradle.kts`.
- **Debug builds use `applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"`** so a pull request's APK installs next to the
  released app instead of conflicting with it.
- **Releases are GitHub Releases with a signed APK**, published by `gh release create` (preinstalled
  on runners) instead of a third-party action, which means one fewer dependency with write access.
  The R8 mapping file is attached to each release.
- **Signing secrets** are base64 and decoded by a tolerant, tested script (`scripts/decode_keystore.py`)
  that never prints the secret. The key password is checked with a small Java program
  (`scripts/VerifySigningKey.java`), because `keytool` ignores the key password of PKCS12 keystores and
  the build would otherwise fail later with an unclear error.
- **Caching:** `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` with `cache-provider: basic` (MIT licensed). The default
  "enhanced" provider is closed source under separate terms of use.
- **CI artifacts:** the debug APK is uploaded unzipped (`archive: false`) so it can be installed on a
  phone straight from the download.
- **Languages:** English (default) + Dutch, as a working example of translations. `generateLocaleConfig`
  makes the app appear under Android's per-app language settings.
- **Persistence:** DataStore when needed (version in the catalog, not added as a dependency yet). No
  network, analytics or crash-reporting libraries.
- **No instrumented/UI tests** yet: they need an emulator in CI (slow, flaky). Logic is kept in plain
  Kotlin and unit tested instead. Manual device checks are listed in `docs/testing.md`.
- **No lint baseline:** the template has zero lint issues.
- **Play Store upload** is prepared but commented out in `release.yml` until a Play Console app and
  service account exist.
