# Rules for Claude Code sessions in this repository

Noter (Play Store listing: "Noter for Notion"), an Android note app on Notion databases, built from the `android-app` template
(a private repository). The owner is **not a developer and does not review code**. CI, tests, lint and these rules
are the safety net. Follow them every time.

## Workflow
1. **One focused change per branch and pull request.** Start a new branch from an up-to-date
   `main` (`git fetch origin main && git checkout -b <branch> origin/main`). Never reuse an old
   or merged branch for a new change.
2. **Before finishing, run and fix everything:**
   ```
   ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug
   ```
   CI builds the debug and release APKs on every push, so don't build them here unless a step below asks for it.
   If you touched `scripts/` or the workflows, also run `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests`.
   If you touched `worker/`, also run `node --test worker/test/noter-sign-in.test.mjs`.
   Then push and make sure CI on the pull request is green.
3. **Write the pull request description in plain language** (fill in `.github/pull_request_template.md`):
   what changed and why, in words a non-developer understands, and **exactly what to tap on the
   phone to test it** (step by step, with what they should see). The owner tests by installing
   the debug APK from the pull request's CI run (Checks → CI → Artifacts).
4. **Testing on the phone does not block merging.** The owner doesn't review code, so green CI is
   what a pull request needs to be merged. The owner tries the change afterwards with the test steps
   from the description (the debug APK stays on the pull request's CI run, and every push to
   `main` builds a new one) and always before a release. A problem found then is fixed in a new
   pull request.

## Never do these without asking first (and saying why)
- Delete, skip, `@Ignore`, or weaken tests, lint checks, CI steps or workflows to make something
  pass. Don't add a lint baseline or disable a lint check. **Never remove the release workflow.**
- Add Android permissions or network destinations beyond the ones in `PRIVACY.md` (Notion's
  API, `api.notion.com`, and Noter's own sign-in helper in `worker/`), analytics, crash reporting,
  ads or tracking. Notion calls only in `data/api/NotionClient.kt`, within Notion's rate limit
  (about three requests per second); sign-in helper calls only in `data/api/SignInClient.kt`.
  The helper must stay stateless: it never stores or logs tokens or notes.
- Add new dependencies (libraries or Gradle plugins). Prefer what is already in
  `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Use **DataStore** if the app needs to store data.
- Change the `applicationId` or the signing setup of an app that has already been released
  (phones will refuse to update it).
- Change `LICENSE` or add licence headers (the owner decides how the code may be used).

## Never commit
Secrets, keystores (`*.jks`, `*.keystore`), `keystore.properties`, passwords or API keys.

## Code rules
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Material 3, single `app` module, mainstream libraries only.
- **Every logic change gets new or updated unit tests** (`app/src/test/`). Keep logic in plain
  Kotlin classes without Android types (no `Context`, `View`, Compose) so it runs on the JVM.
  Composables only display state and forward clicks.
- **All user-visible text goes in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`**, never hard-coded.
  Add the translation to **every** `values-xx/strings.xml` (currently: `nl`, `fr`, `de`, `es`, `it`),
  using the shared wording in `DESIGN.md`.
- **Stored data and backup:** settings the user would want on a new phone go in the DataStore
  `backed_up_settings` (Android backs it up); sign-in tokens, keys and device-only state go in
  another file (never backed up). See `docs/architecture.md`, "Backup".
- Dependency versions live only in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- Versions are automatic (git tags / release workflow). Don't edit `versionName`/`versionCode`.

## Keep docs in sync
- Behaviour change → update `docs/` and, if it touches data or permissions, `PRIVACY.md`.
- Notable decision (new library, architecture choice, minSdk change, …) → add a dated entry to
  `docs/decisions.md`.
- Structure and conventions: `docs/architecture.md`. What is tested and how: `docs/testing.md`.
- `DESIGN.md`: only its "This app" section belongs to this repository. The other sections are
  copied from the master copy in the android-app template (`wimvdon/android-app`): change a
  shared rule there first, then copy it unchanged to every app (Watchlist, Time Tracker
  for Notion, Snoozer, RSS Reader, Noter for Notion).

## Releasing (only when the owner asks)
Actions → Release → Run workflow on `main` → choose `patch`, `minor` or `major`.
See README "Making a release".
